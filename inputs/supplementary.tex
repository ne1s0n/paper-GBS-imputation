\subsection{SNP calling thresholds}
\label{sec:SNP_calling_thresholds}
Genotype calling can incur in two types of error, namely a heterozygote wrongly identified as homozigote ($HET \rightarrow HOM$) and the reverse case ($HOM \rightarrow HET$). 
Under the simplifying hypothesis of absence of sequencing errors and homogeneous sequencing quality, it is possible to estimate error rates for a tetraploid genome using the following formula:

\begin{equation}
\begin{cases}
0.75^{N_h} + 0.25^{N_h} & HET_{3-1} \rightarrow HOM \\ 
2 \times 0.5^{N_h}      & HET_{2-2} \rightarrow HOM \\ 
0                       & HOM \rightarrow HET
\end{cases}
\end{equation}

Where $N_h$ is the minimum number of reads required to label a stack of aligning reads as heterozygote. The discussed case of $N_h = 11$ brings to a total expected $HET \rightarrow HOM$ error rate of 4.22\%.\\
The hypothesis mentioned above greatly simplyfies the real case (e.g. $HOM \rightarrow HET$ errors can not happen, since a homozigote will always produce 100\% of reads of the same type). When accounting sequencing errors and reads quality a term for $HOM \rightarrow HET$ appears, due to reads sequenced as the wrong allele. In the presented study we thus applied a threshold of 4 required reads per stack to call a homozigote to minimize this kind of error.
